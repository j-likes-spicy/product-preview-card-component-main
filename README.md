Hey Everyone,

Thanks for visiting and/or reading. This was a fairly straightforward and unique challenge. All in all, it was completed with 197 lines of CSS and 58 lines of HTML. It took me a few hours to do (while being simultaneously sidetracked by various things). My biggest emphasis here was on best practices, although staying consistent is a big thing for me too. Let me know how I did and what I could do differently and/or improve on. More to come :D!
